# Machine Learning Package for Text Classification


This repository contains codes of machine learning algorithms for text classification, abbreviated to MLP-TC (**M**achine **L**earning **P**ackage for **T**ext **C**lassification).
Due to the poor reproducibility of classification modelling on different datasets with different algorithms in Jupyter, and thus this package is borned. This package is designed in a way especially suitable for researchers conducting comparison experiments and benchmarking analysis.
This package empowers to explore the performance difference that different ML techniques have on your specific datasets.  _Updated: 2019/12/09._

## Highlights

- Well logged for the whole process of training a model for text classification 
- Fed different datasets into models quickly as long as they are formatted as required.
- Support single or multi label (only binary relevance at this stage) classification
- Support model save, load, train, predict, eval, etc.
